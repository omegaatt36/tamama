# Tamama - Terminal Boids Simulation

A real-time flocking simulation using the Boids algorithm, rendered in your terminal.

## Features

- **Dynamic Boid Count**: Automatically adjusts flock size based on terminal dimensions
- **Sine Wave Leadership**: Invisible leader guides the flock in smooth wave patterns
- **Adaptive Boundaries**: Boids bounce off terminal edges naturally
- **Live Controls**: Pause, reset, and adjust frame rate on the fly

## Controls

- `Space` - Pause/Resume simulation
- `F` - Toggle between 30/60 FPS
- `R` - Reset simulation
- `Q` - Quit

## Installation

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

```bash
cargo run --release
```

## Requirements

- Rust 1.70+
- Terminal with Unicode support
